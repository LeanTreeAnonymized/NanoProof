"""
Web-based monitoring for the RL training loop.

Provides a real-time web dashboard showing:
- Training stats (loss, step, etc.)
- Prover server status with thread-level indicators
- GPU utilization and memory
- Inference wait times
- Tail of stdout.log / stderr.log from the run dir

The monitor runs a Flask server in a background thread. The web app polls
for state updates every second.
