    Callers drive it with two modes:

    - **Collect** is persistent: ``install_collect()`` is called once at
      startup with the matchmaker, the experience holder, and the search
      config. Actors then sample theorems from the matchmaker, write
      attempts and tactics into the holder, and feed outcomes back to

      barrier on the holder's transition counter.

      in-flight collect actors, swaps to eval state, runs to completion,
      drains again, and restores collect. Eval bookkeeping (per-call
      results list and theorem iterator) lives on the worker only for
      the duration of the call.

    Actors carry a single abort signal (``_release_event``) used by
    ``evaluate`` to drop in-flight Lean leases at the boundaries; collect
    never sets it. ``_shutdown_event`` is set in :meth:`close` and wakes
